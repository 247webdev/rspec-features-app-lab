# RSpec Features App Lab

The goal for this lab is to build an application thinking about what the user will do in the application, and buildinga series of features specifications (specs) to specify the user’s actions. 

You should primarily think about the “[happy paths](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path)” the user may take in your application. 

Your goal should not be to specify the [edge cases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_case) or [corner cases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_case).

## App description and discussion

Let’s assume that you want to build a weather app, which gives the user the ability to search for weather reports by zipcode, and add certain locations to a list of favorite locations.

### Draw up some wireframes for what this app may look like

### Figure out the low hanging fruit features we can build quickly, that would still give the user some minimum useful functionality (mvp)

### Talk about a specification for those fatures (how will the user interact with the application)

## Specification components

### Setup
* What are the prerequisites of the test?
* Does stuff need to exist in the database?
* Does a user need to be logged in?

### Exercise
* Fill in forms
* Click buttons, links, etc
* Submit forms

### Verify
* Does the next page have what the user will expect it to have?

### Teardown
* Mostly RSpec will take care of it for you
